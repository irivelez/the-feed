# The Feed 📡

Daily AI intelligence digest — automated, curated, ready for content creation.

## What is this?

This repo is the bridge between **discovery** (automated AI content sourcing) and **creation** (writing with your own angle via Claude Code).

Every day at 6 AM PT, a fresh digest lands in `digests/` as a structured markdown file.

## How to use with Claude Code

```
Read today's digest from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irivelez/the-feed/main/digests/latest.md and let's create content about [your angle]
```

## Structure

- `digests/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — Daily digest files
- `digests/latest.md` — Always points to the most recent digest
- `sources.md` — Current source configuration

## Sources

23 X/Twitter accounts, 13 RSS feeds, 5 subreddits, HN — curated for AI, agentic systems, and business impact.

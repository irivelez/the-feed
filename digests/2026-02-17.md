# AI Intelligence Digest — 2026-02-17

## TL;DR
- Agentic coding tools (Codex, Claude Code, Cursor) hitting mainstream inflection — adoption hockey-sticking, tooling layer (MCP, observability, desktop) maturing fast
- OpenAI aggressively consolidating talent for personal agents — agent platform war intensifying
- Production agent architectures now documented: Klarna (85M users), Harmonic (VC investing), Exa (deep research) — playbook exists, execution is the bottleneck
- Agent observability/evaluation stack crystallizing around LangSmith — can't ship agents you can't debug
- Contrarian: even Anthropic engineers say humans still own strategy, customer understanding, judgment — AI augments the craft, doesn't replace the craftsperson

## Big Picture
Agentic AI has crossed from prototype to production infrastructure — the race now is who owns the stack, with OpenAI hoovering up talent, enterprise deployments hitting tens of millions of users, and coding agents tripling adoption in months.

## Key Data Points
| Stat | Context |
|------|---------|
| 85M users | Klarna's AI assistant via LangGraph — largest public enterprise agent deployment |
| 3x weekly users | OpenAI Codex tripled its user base in 2026 |
| 44K ♥ | Peter Steinberger joining OpenAI — talent consolidation is the narrative |
| 1,687 ♥ | Claude Code lazy-loading MCP architecture detail went viral |

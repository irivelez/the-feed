# AI Signal Digest — 2026-02-22

> The 'Claw' era is here: AI agents escaped the chat box and are now autonomous actors with hardware, tools, and their own vocabulary — and the infrastructure race has pivoted from raw compute to cheap, fast, agentic inference.

## Key Data Points
- **77.1% on ARC-AGI-2** — Gemini 3.1 Pro doubled previous reasoning scores, intensifying the frontier model race
- **15K tokens/sec + 1M context windows** — Speed and context breakthroughs designed for agent-to-agent communication, not humans
- **15,344 likes on Karpathy's claw hardware post** — Mac Minis selling out as devs rush to build personal AI agents — mainstream inflection point
- **Top 30 → Top 5 via harness engineering** — LangChain's coding agent leapt rankings by optimizing agent scaffolding, not the model itself

## TL;DR
- **'Claws' are now a category**: Karpathy, Willison, and the dev community have named and legitimized personal autonomous AI agents — hardware is selling out, vocabulary is solidifying
- **Gemini 3.1 Pro fires a shot**: Google doubles reasoning benchmarks and ships impressive agentic demos, forcing real model selection decisions for builders
- **Infrastructure pivots to agents**: Sandboxing, subagent worktrees, automatic caching, and million-token contexts are all optimizing for autonomous agent workflows, not human chat
- **Cheap inference > massive compute**: The contrarian thesis gaining traction — millions of tokens for pennies matters more than millions of GPUs
- **Agentic security is now urgent**: Real prompt injection attacks on coding agents (Cline, OpenClaw) prove the security problem has moved from theoretical to production

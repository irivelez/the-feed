# AI Daily Digest — 2026-02-23

## TL;DR
- **'Claws' are now a category**: Karpathy, Willison, and the dev community have named and legitimized personal autonomous AI agents — hardware is selling out, vocabulary is solidifying
- **Gemini 3.1 Pro fires a shot**: Google doubles reasoning benchmarks and ships impressive agentic demos, forcing real model selection decisions for builders
- **Infrastructure pivots to agents**: Sandboxing, subagent worktrees, automatic caching, and million-token contexts are all optimizing for autonomous agent workflows, not human chat
- **Cheap inference > massive compute**: The contrarian thesis gaining traction — millions of tokens for pennies matters more than millions of GPUs
- **Agentic security is now urgent**: Real prompt injection attacks on coding agents (Cline, OpenClaw) prove the security problem has moved from theoretical to production

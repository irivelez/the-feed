# AI Digest — 2026-02-18

## 🌐 Big Picture

The agentic stack is crystallizing fast — models are commoditizing toward Opus-level at Sonnet prices, coding agents are going mainstream (even Torvalds uses them), and the real battleground is shifting from 'can AI code?' to 'who controls the tooling layer around it.'

## 📊 Key Data Points

- **3x weekly users** — OpenAI Codex tripled active users since early 2026 — coding agents hit mainstream adoption
- **<18 months to human-level** — Computer use / UI automation approaching human parity faster than most orgs are planning for
- **7,692♥ on Karpathy's take** — Most-engaged item: LLMs making formal verification practical — signals deep rethinking of software quality
- **Same-day Sonnet 4.6 shipping** — Perplexity, Cursor, and others deployed Sonnet 4.6 within hours — model adoption cycles now measured in hours, not weeks

## 📝 TL;DR

- Sonnet 4.6 closes the gap with Opus-class models, compressing the price-performance curve and forcing faster adoption decisions across the stack
- Coding agents are no longer experimental — Codex 3x growth, Torvalds adopting agentic workflows, Cursor expanding plugins — the default dev loop is shifting
- Claude's expanding tool ecosystem (code exec, web fetch, memory) and ACP protocol signal that agent infrastructure is consolidating around a few key patterns
- The moat debate intensifies: Isenberg says skills/taste beat code, Swyx calls out performative coders, Willison argues CLIs beat MCPs — the builder-vs-talker divide sharpens
- Open-source competition heats up with Qwen3.5 multimodal agents while practitioner frameworks (Mollick's guide, trustworthy analysis) race to help orgs actually adopt responsibly

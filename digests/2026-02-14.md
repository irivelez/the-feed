# 📡 AI Intelligence Digest — February 14, 2026

> **Big Picture:** The AI coding agent war just went mainstream — with Codex hitting 1M downloads and GPT-5.3 shipping natively in every major IDE, we've crossed from 'will agents replace developers?' to 'which agent wins?' Meanwhile, the productivity gains everyone promised are proving stubbornly elusive beyond raw coding speed.

---

## 🔑 TL;DR

1. **Coding agents hit an inflection point:** GPT-5.3 Codex ships in Cursor/VS Code/GitHub while Codex app crosses 1M downloads — the IDE is now an agent runtime, not a text editor
2. **Anthropic plays the safety card hard:** Opus 4.5 approaches ASL-4 autonomous thresholds, they preemptively adopt stricter standards, and commit to absorbing data center energy costs — positioning as the 'responsible frontier' lab
3. **The productivity paradox gets louder:** multiple signals confirm AI makes coding 10x faster but overall dev productivity barely budges, and contrarian research argues AI intensifies work rather than reducing it
4. **Agentic infrastructure is maturing fast:** semantic crons, structured context engineering, model councils with memory, and deep research with app integrations all point to agents becoming persistent, orchestrated systems rather than chat toys
5. **OpenAI goes full platform war:** Skills API for agentic capabilities, deep research upgrades to GPT-5.2 with external app access, and ads in ChatGPT — they're building the everything-app while monetizing the free tier

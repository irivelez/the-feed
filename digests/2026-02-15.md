## TL;DR

- **Coding agents hit inflection:** GPT-5.3 Codex ships in Cursor/VS Code/GitHub; Codex app crosses 1M downloads — the IDE is now an agent runtime
- **Anthropic plays safety card:** Opus 4.5 approaches ASL-4 autonomous thresholds; preemptive stricter standards; absorbing data center energy costs
- **Productivity paradox gets louder:** AI makes coding 10x faster but overall dev productivity barely budges; contrarian research argues AI intensifies work
- **Agentic infra maturing fast:** Semantic crons, structured context engineering, model councils with memory — agents becoming persistent orchestrated systems
- **OpenAI goes full platform war:** Skills API, deep research upgrades to GPT-5.2, ads in ChatGPT — building the everything-app

## 📊 Key Data Points

| Stat | Context |
|------|---------|
| **1M downloads in first week** | Codex app adoption with 60% growth — coding agents are mass-market |
| **93,000 lines of code in 5 days** | Claude Opus 4.6 vs GPT-5.3 Codex real production output |
| **10x speed, 1.25x productivity** | The AI coding paradox: speed ≠ productivity |

## 🌍 Big Picture

The AI coding agent war just went mainstream — with Codex hitting 1M downloads and GPT-5.3 shipping natively in every major IDE, we've crossed from "will agents replace developers?" to "which agent wins?" Meanwhile, the productivity gains everyone promised are proving stubbornly elusive beyond raw coding speed.

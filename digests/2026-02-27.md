# AI Daily Digest — February 27, 2026

> **Big Picture:** AI agents are shipping into every workflow from code to video to robotics — but the guardrails are crumbling just as fast, with Anthropic abandoning safety promises, Google accidentally weaponizing API keys, and LLMs deanonymizing users at scale.

## TL;DR
- Anthropic weakened its core safety commitments while its people advise the Pentagon — the gap between safety rhetoric and commercial reality is now undeniable
- Multi-agent orchestration went from research concept to crowded market overnight, with at least 3 open-source frameworks published in a single news cycle
- Google's Gemini silently turned API keys into security liabilities, exposing how fast AI integration can create attack surfaces no one planned for
- AI agents are embedding into production creative tools — Figma, Adobe Firefly, and vibe-coded apps show the IDE-to-design-to-video pipeline closing fast
- The contrarian signal is strong: LLM overuse critique (245 upvotes) and AI 3D "slop autopsy" suggest builder fatigue with hype is becoming its own movement
